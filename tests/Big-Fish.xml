<character>FINAL PRODUCTION DRAFT</character>
<talk>includes post-production dialogue 
and omitted scenes
Copyright: Copyright © 2003 Columbia Pictures</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.</action>

<page-break />

<slug><b>FADE IN:</b></slug>

<action>A RIVER.</action>

<action>We’re underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.  </action>

<action>This is The Beast.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.)</character>
<talk>There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It’s not that they’re faster or stronger than other fish.  They’re just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.  </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>The Beast’s journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.  Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.  Past a swiping bear claw.  The Beast isn’t worried.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)</character>
<talk>By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He’d taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who’d drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.</talk>
</dialogue>

<sceneheading>INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)</sceneheading>

<action>WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40’s and handsome, tells the story.  In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.  All I knew was I’d been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.  </talk>
<paren>(closer)</paren>
<talk>And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.</talk>
</dialogue>

<sceneheading>EXT.  CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)</sceneheading>

<action>A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.  </action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>Now, I’d tried everything on it:  worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.  But on that day I had a revelation:  if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn’t going to work.  I would have to use something he truly desired. </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.</action>

<action>While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.  He’s heard this story before.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>I tied my ring to the strongest line they made &#8209;&#8209; strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes &#8209;&#8209; and I cast upriver.</talk>
</dialogue>

<sceneheading>INT.  BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)</sceneheading>

<action>Edward is chatting up Will’s pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.  She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward’s charisma.  He’s hypnotizing.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.  And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.  His mother SANDRA &#8209;&#8209; from whom he gets his good looks and practicality &#8209;&#8209; stands with him at the door.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>You can see my predicament.  My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.</talk>

</dialogue>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.  I looked him straight in the eye.  And I made a remarkable discovery. </talk>
</dialogue>

<sceneheading>INT.  TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)</sceneheading>

<action>WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.  This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.  They should be joyful, but Will is furious.</action>

<action>Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.  The room is cozy and drunk.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>This fish, the Beast.  The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.  It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.  She looks gorgeous.  She couldn’t be any happier if this were her own wedding.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>Now, I was in a situation.  I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.  </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Will can’t take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn’t even notice.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?  This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.</talk>

<talk>Honey, it’s still your night.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Will can’t articulate his anger.  He just leaves.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn’t the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?</talk>
<paren>(closer; he holds up his ring)</paren>
<talk>That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.  </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is &#8209;&#8209; and has always been &#8209;&#8209; about her more than anyone.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>A LAUGH from the crowd.  </action>

<action>Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.  As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.  </action>

<action>As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.  The crowd APPLAUDS.</action>

<action>Edward toasts the happy couple.  Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.</action>

<action>Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT</sceneheading>

<action>We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.  Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.  Both men are a little drunk.</action>

<action>Edward swims laps in the family pool.  He’s born to the water.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL (V.O.)</character>
<talk>The truth is, I didn’t see anything of myself in my father, and I don’t think he saw anything of himself in me.  We were like strangers who knew each other very well.</talk>
</dialogue>

<sceneheading>EXT.  RIVER - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL (V.O.)</character>
<talk>In telling the story of my father’s life, it’s impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.  The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward’s reflection is caught in the dark water.  As the water ripples past, something changes.  </action>

<action>Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it’s a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20’s, staring into the water.  He’s not just handsome, not just charming.  It’s as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL (V.O.) (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>It doesn’t always make sense, and most of it never happened.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of</action>

<slug>THE BEAST.</slug>

<action>He brings the catfish up to his face.  Looks it right in the eye.  A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward’s gold ring.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL (V.O.) (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>But that’s what kind of story this is.</talk>

<talk>Now, Mrs. Bloom, I’ll need you to give me one good push.  On three.  One... </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor’s unprepared hands.  Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.  It shoots up into air.</action>

<action>The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.  As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.</action>

<action>As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.  Everyone races after it.</action>

</dialogue>

<sceneheading>INT.  HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.  By the tone of the ring, we know we’re not in the U.S. &#8209;&#8209; it has that insistent European sound.  </action>

<action>As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.  A cradle is still in its carton.</action>

<action>KEYS in the lock.  LAUGHTER in the hallway.  The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain.  His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.  </action>

<action>As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French.  Will has a window seat in coach.  Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.  </action>

<action>Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.  There's an effortless intimacy between them.  She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.</action>

<sceneheading>INT.  747 / FLYING - NIGHT</sceneheading>

<action>Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.  Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.  Her head is propped against Will’s shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly. </action>

<action>Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.  A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.  </action>

<action>Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.   The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.</action>

<action>The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.  And on a silent count of one, two, three &#8209;&#8209; Edward looks into The Eye.</action>

<action>This time we don’t cut.  Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death.  He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused.  Whatever he sees, it’s not as dire as the other boys.  His future has something strange in store.</action>

<sceneheading>INT.  FOYER - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs.  They CREAK with every step.</action>

<action>The wall is filled with family photos, happier times.  Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding.  As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step.</action>

<action>A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.  Will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper.</action>

<action>Almost at the door, he stops for a beat.  Gets his breath.  Then goes inside.</action>

<sceneheading>INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed.  Although he’s not the vibrant man we’ve seen before, it’s not as bad we feared.  The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.</action>

<action>Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses.  He tries to say something, but no words come out.</action>

<action>He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand.  Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.</action>

<action>Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself.  A very long, tense beat.  Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.  </action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL</character>
<talk>Just drink half the can.  I’ll tell her you drank the whole thing.  Everyone wins.</talk>

<talk>I was never much for being at home, Will.  It’s too confining.  And this, here.  Being stuck in bed.  Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.</talk>

<action>Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave.  And then another.  His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, wondering what’s wrong.  Embarrassed, Edward just keeps SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.</action>

<action>He pulls at his collar.  Then pulls again, his face getting red.  Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.  He’s starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.  Two more buttons fly off.  One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.</action>

<character>EDWARD (V.O.)</character>
<talk>My muscles couldn’t keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn’t keep up with my body’s ambition.

<action>Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave.  Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant’s feast:  broken barrels, bones picked clean.</action>

<action>In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:</action>

<action>There’s no answer.</action>

<action>Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.</action>

<action>Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.  Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.</action>

<action>KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you’ve ever seen.  Not just tall, but massive.  He’s completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.  What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.  God knows what’s living in his matted hair.</action>

<talk>So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.  Because I’m not much for pain, really.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.  Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.</action>

<action>After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.  Relieved to see he’s not licking his chops &#8209;&#8209;</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>Look, I can’t go back.  I’m a human sacrifice.  If I go back, everyone will think I’m a coward.  And I’d rather be dinner than a coward.</talk>

<action>Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>Here, start with my hand.  It’ll be an appetizer.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl’s mouth.  But the giant spits it back out.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>KARL</character>
<talk>I don’t want to eat you.  I don’t want to eat anybody.  It’s just I get so hungry.  I’m too big.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>And that’s the sad truth.  Karl is less a monster than a freak &#8209;&#8209; a giant man, but in the end, just a man.</action>

<action>Edward takes a seat beside him.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>Did you ever think maybe you’re not too big?  Maybe this town’s just too small.  I mean, look at it.</talk>

<action>Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton &#8209;&#8209; a tiny town in a tiny valley.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  RIVER - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl.  There’s a few tears amid the familiar faces.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>MAYOR</character>
<paren>(loudly, for the crowd)</paren>
<talk>Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it’s with a heavy heart we see you go.  But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck.  The crowd CHEERS.  And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go.</action>

<action>Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn’t sad to see Edward go.  He crushes his cigarette under his heel.  He wishes he could crush Edward.</action>

<action>Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.  </action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.)</character>
<talk>That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.</talk>
</dialogue>

<dialogue>
<character>VARIOUS TOWNFOLK</character>
<talk>Find yourself a nice girl!  Don’t trust anyone in Kentucky!  Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!</talk>
</dialogue>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.)</character>
<talk>But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others. </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with </action>

<slug>THE OLD WOMAN. </slug>

<action>The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.  She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.  Although we’re VERY CLOSE, we can’t hear her voice.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<paren>(to the Old Woman)</paren>
<talk>Okay.  Thanks.</talk>

<action>Edward and Karl keep walking.  The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.</action>

<talk>What did she say?</talk>
</dialogue>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>

<sceneheading>EXT.  ROAD - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.  Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.)</character>
<talk>There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn’t.  People didn’t use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.  The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>KARL</character>
<talk>You know anyone’s who’s taken it?</talk>
</dialogue>

<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>That poet, Norther Winslow did.  He was going to Paris, France.  He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.</talk>

<talk>You’re not trying to run away?</talk>
</dialogue>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>Just to be sure, you can take my pack.  </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  DIRT ROAD - DAY </sceneheading>

<action>The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.  The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.</action>

<action>Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it’s a day meant for whistling.  </action>

<sceneheading>EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH</sceneheading>

<action>The road has narrowed to a rough path.  Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.  Still, Edward WHISTLES.</action>

<action>Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.  He stops.  For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.  The forest is dead quiet.</action>

<action>He looks back the way he came.  It’s tempting to go back.  It would be easier to go back.  But Edward presses on.</action>

<action>He carefully steps through the thorns.  His trouser legs catch on the barbs.  We can hear the fabric TEAR.</action>

<slug>FURTHER ALONG </slug>

<action>A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.  Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD</character>
<talk>You stupid sonofa...</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.  The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE’S NEST.  The swarm roars out.</action>

<action>Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]</sceneheading>

<action>Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.  </action>

<action>A half-broken sign lies in the road.  Edward picks it up.  Reads it:</action>

<slug>WARNING!  </slug>

<action>JUMPING SPIDERS!</action>

<action>Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (V.O.)</character>
<talk>There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he’s made a terrible mistake.  The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.  </talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.</talk>
</dialogue>

<sceneheading>EXT.  CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY  </sceneheading>

<action>Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.  One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.  Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.</action>

<action>At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting. </action>

<action>Ahead lies a tiny one-street town &#8209;&#8209; smaller even than Ashton &#8209;&#8209; with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.  Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.</action>

<action>He passes a sign that reads “Welcome To Spectre!”</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  THE TOWN OF SPECTRE   - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>It’s a main street with stores on each side:  Cole’s Pharmacy, Talbot’s Five and Dime, Al’s Country Store.  Everything is old, but this isn’t a ghost town.  In fact, there’s a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.  Most are smiling.  There are even a few tears of joy.</action>

<action>What’s more, all of these people are barefoot.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>MAN’S VOICE</character>
<talk>Friend!</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.  Friendly but a little drunk, he’s the closest thing the town has to a mayor.  He’s carrying a clipboard.</action>

<action>He chases after her.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY  </sceneheading>

<action>As she runs, Jenny ties Edward’s laces together.  Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line &#8209;&#8209; a perfect throw.  There’s no way he’s ever getting them down.</action>

<action>The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.  The women hug him.  Men shake his hand.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  BY THE RIVER - NIGHT</sceneheading>

<action>By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.  The Key to the City dangles around his neck.  </action>

<action>He stares at himself in the reflection.  He smiles.</action>

<action>It’s then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.  No telling where she came from &#8209;&#8209; she must have been swimming underwater.  We never see her face.</action>

<action>She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.  Edward is breathless.  It’s the first woman he’s seen in her natural state, and he doesn’t dare move lest he frighten her away.</action>

<action>Then he sees the snake.</action>

<action>It’s a cottonmouth, has to be.  It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.  There’s no decision to be made.  On pure instinct, Edward dives in.  He swims as hard as can, </action>

<slug>GRABBING THE SNAKE</slug>

<action>just as it’s about to strike.</action>

<action>The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her.  </action>

<talk>No, it’s okay!  I got it.  I got the snake.</talk>

<action>As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands.  Which isn’t a snake at all, but rather a common stick.  And a non-threatening one at that.</action>

<action>While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.  He never even saw her face.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>EDWARD (CONT’D)</character>
<talk>Wait!  I’m sorry.  Hello?!</talk>

<action>As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find “downtown” has been transformed.  Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS.</action>

<action>The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.  Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.</action>

<action>The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.  From FARMER to BAKER’S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool.  Still, he’s having a blast.</action>

<action>Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.</action>

<action>Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.   Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward.  It’s hard to hear over the MUSIC.</action>

<action>The trees ahead are moving.  At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there’s no mistaking it:  they’re trying to block him.</action>

<action>Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.  He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one’s branches.  He swings off, lands and rolls.

<action>No choice, Edward stops the car.  Puts on the handbrake.  Just as suddenly, the sound changes &#8209;&#8209; no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING.  The world is close and echoing, because &#8209;&#8209;</action>

<action>That’s when he sees her &#8209;&#8209; The Girl in the River.  </action>

<action>She’s swimming outside the car.  While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her.</action>

<action>That’s all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him.  He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.</action>

<action>MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.</action>

<sceneheading>INT.  HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the elevator.</action>

<sceneheading>INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in.  She strips the bed.</action>

<sceneheading>INT.  BEDROOM - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Will and his mother pick out one of Edward’s ties, for Will to wear at the funeral.  Will tries to button the cuffs on the shirt he borrowed, but they’re the kind that need links.</action>

<action>He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to find a matching pair.  Further down, he finds a ribbon tied to </action>

<slug>THE KEY TO THE CITY.</slug>

<action>He smiles, disbelieving.  It’s a real thing.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>Will helps his mother out of a black sedan.  She’s well-composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.  </action>

<action>Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE.  The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than expected.  </action>

<action>As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see an Oldsmobile parking.</action>

<action>CLOSE ON the license plates.  Missouri.</action>

<action>The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely visible over the door.  He shuts it to reveal himself to be 70.</action>

<action>It’s Amos Calloway.  Will doesn’t recognize him.</action>

<action>The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel.  We TILT UP to see this man is huge.</action>

<action>This man is KARL, now 55.  He’s not 12 feet tall, but at least six-eight.</action>

<action>CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists. </action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY</sceneheading>

<action>As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother to a seat near the grave.</action>

<action>Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN (50) behind them.  A beat later, an identical face with glasses peers out &#8209;&#8209; the woman’s twin sister.  </action>

<action>It’s PING and JING.</action>

<action>Josephine almost GASPS.  She elbows Will, who turns to look.  From this angle, the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing steps forward.  They’re really two separate people.</action>

<action>A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years:  BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.</action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]</sceneheading>

<action>After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups.  By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they’re telling stories.  They’re telling Edward’s stories.</action>

<action>We find Will watching them.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL (V.O.)</character>
<talk>Have you ever heard a joke so many times you’ve forgotten why it’s funny?  But then you hear it again and suddenly it’s new.  You remember why you loved it in the first place.</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Will joins in, laughing.</action>

<action>We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the screen.  </action>

<sceneheading>EXT.  BLOOM HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY [SUMMER]</sceneheading>

<action>Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.</action>

<character>SON</character>
<talk>See.  So he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn’t afraid of anything because he’d seen how he was going to die in this old lady’s glass eye...</talk>
</dialogue>

<action>Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES.  Sandra takes Will’s hand in hers, just listening.</action>

<dialogue>
<character>WILL (V.O.)</character>
<talk>That was my father’s final joke I guess.  A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories.  They live on after him.</talk>
