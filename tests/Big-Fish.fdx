<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text><Text Style="Bold">FADE IN:</Text></Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A RIVER.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>We’re underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>This is The Beast.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It’s not that they’re faster or stronger than other fish.  They’re just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The Beast’s journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.  Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.  Past a swiping bear claw.  The Beast isn’t worried.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He’d taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who’d drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40’s and handsome, tells the story.  In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.  All I knew was I’d been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.  </Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(closer)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>EXT.  CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Now, I’d tried everything on it:  worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.  But on that day I had a revelation:  if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn’t going to work.  I would have to use something he truly desired. </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward slips his ring off.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Gold.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.  He’s heard this story before.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I tied my ring to the strongest line they made &#8209;&#8209; strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes &#8209;&#8209; and I cast upriver.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward is chatting up Will’s pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.  She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward’s charisma.  He’s hypnotizing.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.  And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.  His mother SANDRA &#8209;&#8209; from whom he gets his good looks and practicality &#8209;&#8209; stands with him at the door.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>You can see my predicament.  My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>ON WILL AND SANDRA</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(low but insistent)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Make him stop.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL’S DATE</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>What did you do?</Text></Paragraph>



<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.  I looked him straight in the eye.  And I made a remarkable discovery. </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.  This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.  They should be joyful, but Will is furious.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.  The room is cozy and drunk.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>This fish, the Beast.  The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.  It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.  She looks gorgeous.  She couldn’t be any happier if this were her own wedding.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Now, I was in a situation.  I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will can’t take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn’t even notice.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?  This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father&#8209;&#8209;</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD AND WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>We were part of the same equation.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>SANDRA</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Honey, it’s still your night.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will can’t articulate his anger.  He just leaves.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn’t the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(closer; he holds up his ring)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is &#8209;&#8209; and has always been &#8209;&#8209; about her more than anyone.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A LAUGH from the crowd.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.  As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.  The crowd APPLAUDS.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward toasts the happy couple.  Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>EXT.  OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.  Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.  Both men are a little drunk.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>What, a father’s not allowed to talk about his son?</Text></Paragraph>



<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(disbelieving)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I am a footnote in that story.  I am the context for your great adventure.  Which never happened!  Incidentally!  You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.  </Text></Paragraph>



<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(shaking his head)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Jesus Christ.</Text></Paragraph>



<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Friend of yours?  Did you help him out of a bind?</Text></Paragraph>



<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Come on, Will.  Everyone likes that story.</Text></Paragraph>



<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>No Dad, they don’t.  <Text Style="Underline">I</Text> do not like the story.  Not anymore, not after a <Text Style="Underline">thousand</Text> <Text Style="Underline">times</Text>.  I know all the punchlines, Dad.  I can tell them as well as you can.</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(closer)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.  It revolves around me and my wife.  How can you not understand that?</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A long beat, then...</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(low)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Sorry to embarrass you.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will won’t let him get the last word.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>You’re embarrassing yourself, Dad.  You just don’t see it.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>ANGLE ON Edward.  Fine.  A hand to wave, enough of you. </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He walks away.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.  It’s then we FREEZE FRAME.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>After that night, I didn’t speak to my father again for three years.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A typically busy day.  On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (ON PHONE)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(without pauses)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He’s put back on hold.  Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.  Rips it open.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>We communicated indirectly I guess.  In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>When I’d call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.  Or swimming in the pool.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>True to form, we never talked about our not talking.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Sandra stands by the window, watching as...</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>EXT.  BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward swims laps in the family pool.  He’s born to the water.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>The truth is, I didn’t see anything of myself in my father, and I don’t think he saw anything of himself in me.  We were like strangers who knew each other very well.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>EXT.  RIVER - DAY</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>In telling the story of my father’s life, it’s impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.  The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward’s reflection is caught in the dark water.  As the water ripples past, something changes.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it’s a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20’s, staring into the water.  He’s not just handsome, not just charming.  It’s as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.) (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>It doesn’t always make sense, and most of it never happened.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>THE BEAST.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He brings the catfish up to his face.  Looks it right in the eye.  A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward’s gold ring.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.) (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>But that’s what kind of story this is.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>YOUNG DR. BENNETT</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Now, Mrs. Bloom, I’ll need you to give me one good push.  On three.  One... </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor’s unprepared hands.  Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.  It shoots up into air.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.  As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.  Everyone races after it.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Bursting through the doors &#8209;&#8209;</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Grab that baby!</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby.  Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>My father’s birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.  No longer than most men’s, but larger.  And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.  By the tone of the ring, we know we’re not in the U.S. &#8209;&#8209; it has that insistent European sound.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.  A cradle is still in its carton.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>KEYS in the lock.  LAUGHTER in the hallway.  The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain.  His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>JOSEPHINE</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Allo oui?</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle.  He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(on phone)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Yes, he’s here.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(on phone)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Hi.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant.  She listens carefully to Will’s side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>WILL (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>What does Dr. Bennett say?  Okay.  No, sure, let me talk to him.   I’ll wait.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He covers the mouthpiece.  Looks over to Josephine.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>JOSEPHINE</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>It’s bad.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.  There's an effortless intimacy between them.  She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>INT.  747 / FLYING - NIGHT</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.  Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.  Her head is propped against Will’s shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly. </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.  A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.   The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton.  Kids weren’t supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I’m not going anywhere until you show yourself.  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming.  Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that’s what it’s going to take.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake.  Even Edward starts to worry.  Just how big is this guy?  </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn’t kill me.  All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.  Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you’ve ever seen.  Not just tall, but massive.  He’s completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.  What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.  God knows what’s living in his matted hair.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun.  Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off.  The giant didn’t even notice it.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Why are you here?</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward ponders the best response, settling on...</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>So you can eat me.  The town decided to send a human sacrifice, and I volunteered. </Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Karl’s eyes narrow, confused.  Edward stands up.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>My arms are a little stringy, but there’s some good eating on my legs.  I mean, I’d be tempted to eat them myself.</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Parenthetical"><Text>(beat)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.  Because I’m not much for pain, really.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.  Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.  Relieved to see he’s not licking his chops &#8209;&#8209;</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Look, I can’t go back.  I’m a human sacrifice.  If I go back, everyone will think I’m a coward.  And I’d rather be dinner than a coward.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Here, start with my hand.  It’ll be an appetizer.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>KARL</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I don’t want to eat you.  I don’t want to eat anybody.  It’s just I get so hungry.  I’m too big.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>And that’s the sad truth.  Karl is less a monster than a freak &#8209;&#8209; a giant man, but in the end, just a man.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward takes a seat beside him.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Did you ever think maybe you’re not too big?  Maybe this town’s just too small.  I mean, look at it.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Hardly two stories in the whole place.  Now I’ve heard in real cities, they’ve got buildings so tall you can’t even see the tops of ‘em.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>So why are you wasting your time in a small town?  You’re a big man.  You should be in the big city.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>I love every square inch of it.  But I can feel the edges closing in on me.  A man’s life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it’s with a heavy heart we see you go.  But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn’t sad to see Edward go.  He crushes his cigarette under his heel.  He wishes he could crush Edward.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>THE OLD WOMAN. </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.  She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.  Although we’re VERY CLOSE, we can’t hear her voice.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Okay.  Thanks.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn’t.  People didn’t use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.  The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it’s a day meant for whistling.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The road has narrowed to a rough path.  Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.  Still, Edward WHISTLES.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.  He stops.  For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.  The forest is dead quiet.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He looks back the way he came.  It’s tempting to go back.  It would be easier to go back.  But Edward presses on.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He carefully steps through the thorns.  His trouser legs catch on the barbs.  We can hear the fabric TEAR.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>FURTHER ALONG </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.  Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>You stupid sonofa...</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.  The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE’S NEST.  The swarm roars out.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Scene Heading"><Text>WARNING!  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>JUMPING SPIDERS!</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD (V.O.)</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he’s made a terrible mistake.  The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.  One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.  Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting. </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Ahead lies a tiny one-street town &#8209;&#8209; smaller even than Ashton &#8209;&#8209; with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.  Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.  The Key to the City dangles around his neck.  </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>He stares at himself in the reflection.  He smiles.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>It’s then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.  No telling where she came from &#8209;&#8209; she must have been swimming underwater.  We never see her face.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.  Edward is breathless.  It’s the first woman he’s seen in her natural state, and he doesn’t dare move lest he frighten her away.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Then he sees the snake.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>It’s a cottonmouth, has to be.  It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.  There’s no decision to be made.  On pure instinct, Edward dives in.  He swims as hard as can, </Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Character"><Text>EDWARD</Text></Paragraph>
<Paragraph Type="Dialogue"><Text>No, it’s okay!  I got it.  I got the snake.</Text></Paragraph>


<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands.  Which isn’t a snake at all, but rather a common stick.  And a non-threatening one at that.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.  He never even saw her face.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.  Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.  From FARMER to BAKER’S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool.  Still, he’s having a blast.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>The trees ahead are moving.  At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there’s no mistaking it:  they’re trying to block him.</Text></Paragraph>

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.  He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one’s branches.

<Paragraph Type="Action"><Text>Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out.  But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. </Text></Paragraph>
